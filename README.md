# Welcome Max Sli.dev slides project!

## Synopsis

This project serves as a template for creating new slides for your presentations. It is designed to make it easy to customise and adapt to your specific needs, enabling you to develop professional, captivating presentations quickly and efficiently.

## Getting Started

To start the slide show:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Visit <http://localhost:3030> to view the presentation live

## Editing the Presentation

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) file or files into the [pages](./pages) folder to adjust or enrich your presentation. The changes will be reflected live, allowing you to iterate quickly on your content.

## Additional Resources

The theme used is based on [Slidev Unicorn](https://github.com/antfu/slidev-theme-unicorn), you can modify the theme to your liking [here](./theme/).

For more information on using Slidev, refer to the [official documentation](https://sli.dev/). Slidev provides extensive tools and features to make your presentation interactive and engaging.

The project uses the `slidev-addon-rabbit` addon for Slidev, which is a presentation time management tool. This addon displays a turtle and a rabbit on the back of each slide. When you start your presentation with the parameter `?time=5`, for example, the turtle automatically moves forward according to the time you set. The rabbit, on the other hand, advances according to your progress through the presentation. The aim is for both to arrive at the end of the presentation at the same time, allowing you to manage the time allocated efficiently. (More information on the addon [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slidev-addon-rabbit))
